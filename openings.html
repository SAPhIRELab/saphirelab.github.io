</div>
<br>

<h2>Master's and Ph.D Students</h2>

I have indicated various skills that I am looking for when hiring students, which includes both necessary and also "good to have" skills.
If you think your interests match with the work I am doing, and meet (most) of the requirements below, please fill out the form at: <link>
Given the large volume of emails I receive, please do not send an email and filling the form is sufficient and I can assure you that I will check it regularly.

1. <b>In case of a potential match</b>, I will send a mail asking you to schedule a call by identifying an empty slot in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/calendar/published/5dbe9413947f436888808d87f523519a@uwaterloo.ca/0273e91abf4c4cbba0411c5cd5c0129d6237120652299021335/calendar.html">my calendar</a> for the duration of around 45 minutes to chat and explore whether there is a potential match in terms of research. I might ask you to either read some papers, and identify some interesting research problems that you might want to work on; and/or do a simple programming task (no algorithms; but building some basic system using simple Python functions on CodeSignal).

2. <b>In case I do not reach out will reach out in a month</b>, then consider that most likely you were not selected. Please do not take this personally, as this is a competitive process with lots of students applying with different backgrounds from all around the world. Not being selected is not a reflection of your ability or potential.


<h3>Necessary Requirements</h3>

1. <b>Programming Expertise</b>: Students must have a strong foundation in programming and be proficient at debugging code. They should also be comfortable with replicating, executing, and refactoring existing code. Since our research is empirical, having confidence in coding and implementation is an essential requirement. A strong command of Python is required, along with familiarity with important machine learning libraries such as PyTorch (our primary framework for implementation) and other libraries such as vLLM, HuggingFace, etc.

2. <b>Background on Machine Learning</b>: Students should possess a good understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and generative models, equivalent to the knowledge gained from undergraduate coursework. This should include both the practical skills and the theoretical concepts. Here are some relevant courses as an example of what the students are expected to know: (a) Deep learning course by Ali Ghodsi, (b) courses on LLMs from NPTEL from IIT Delhi and IIT Madras, and (c) Stanford course on "Transformers and LLMs".

3. <b>Clear Communication</b>: Students should be able to clearly describe problems and articulate potential solutions. They must also be able to discuss academic papers and prior research, pointing out their limitations. Students should be capable of proposing tentative solutions based on their understanding of the work.

4. <b>Critical thinking</b>: Systematically review existing literature, critically assess the limitations and gaps in prior work, and design targeted next steps and experiments to test your hypothesis and demonstrate those limitations.

<h3>"Good-to-have" Requirements (Undergraduate/Master's/Ph.D)</h3>

1. <b>Background on Adversarial Risks</b>: I do not expect students to be proficient with background on various adversarial risks to security, privacy, fairness, and transparency. 

2. <b>Background on Trusted hardware/Cryptographic Primitives</b>: For students interested in working on governance of ML systems, having some background on using TEEs (e.g., Intel SGX, TDX, trusted computing on NVIDIA's H100 etc.) or cryptographic primitives (e.g., zero knowledge proofs, multi-party computations) is an additional "good to have" requirement.

3. <b>Experience with research</b>: This includes experience with working as part of some research project, or having published papers. This demonstrates some experience regarding having previously navigated uncertainty of researching novel problems.

But overall, even if the above requirements are not met, I expect students to demonstrate a genuine eagerness and enthusiasm to quickly learn and familiarize with relevant concepts and apply them to research problems. The ability to think critically and approach challenges with curiosity and passion is key.


<h2>Undergraduates</h2>

If you are interested in exploring research, I encourage undergraduates to apply for positions by filling out the <a href="#">form</a>.

You are likely to work closely with a master's or Ph.D. student on a specific project (based on your interests) which is supervised by me.

Ideally, I expect students to have excellent grades in fundamental courses such as programming and machine learning, in addition to the "necessary requirements" indicated above.


<h2>Postdocs</h2>

Please send me an email directly indicating  with your CV and a short research statement (2 pages max) highlighting your past research contributions, and future projects that you intend to explore with me. Generally, I expect the postdoc to have at-least one top tier paper.

<h2>Collaborations (faculty/PIs/Industry research scientists)</h2>

Assuming some common research interests and background, I am interested in exploring joint research projects with faculty from other institutes, principal investigators, or research scientists from the industry.

Please send me an email directly and we can discuss how we can collaborate on some common projects. This could include me working with you and your students on a project, or exploring if you would be interested to work on some projects with my students. 

Note that this the collaboration will depend heavily on the current workload and availability of resources and students to explore some ideas and collaborate. But even otherwise, we can explore the possibility of collaborating in the near future once my workload reduces/resources or students are available.
